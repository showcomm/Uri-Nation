## Goal

You are a dog. You live with your owner. You go on walks. On those walks, you pee on things to claim them as yours.

Your goal is to control the neighbourhood. You win by either:

1. **Territorial Dominance** — Hold 15 marked territories outside your Home Turf at the end of any turn.
2. **Last Dog Standing** — Be the only player who still holds territory outside their own backyard.
3. **Time's Up** — After 30 turns, the player with the most territory wins. Ties broken by most Fortify tokens, then highest Swagger.

---

## Setting Up

1. Place the board. Each player picks a breed card and takes their matching dog figurine, dog bowl, and player colour.
2. Fill your bowl rim with water pegs up to your archetype's max (Bruiser: 6, Scrapper: 3, Diplomat: 4, Yapper: 4).
3. Fill your bowl centre with modifier tokens up to your archetype's max (see your breed card).
4. Place the pee disks in a shared supply in the middle of the table. Pee disks are never stored in your bowl.
5. Place your dog figurine on your Home Turf space.
6. Place one large pee disk on any empty territory adjacent to your Home Turf. This is your starting claim — no cost.
7. Shuffle the three decks (Water Chance, Chance, Events) and place them face-down near the board.
8. Choose a random starting player. Turn order goes counterclockwise around the board based on home turf positions.

## The Board

The board is a neighbourhood of city blocks arranged in a grid. Roads run between the blocks. Sidewalks run along each block face. **You walk along the sidewalks only.** All special spaces — territories, home turfs, dog parks, water sources — sit adjacent to the sidewalk. You never step onto them. You interact with them from the sidewalk space beside them.

### Roads and Crossing

Roads are barriers. You cannot walk along them. You can cross them:

- **Free at intersections.** Your owner naturally crosses at corners. No cost.
- **Mid-block crossing costs 1 Drive token.** You're dragging your owner across traffic. This can happen mid-roll and movement continues afterward.

### Space Types

**Territory** — Residential properties along the sidewalks: yard, driveway, house. You claim the driveway from the adjacent sidewalk. Each territory holds 1 large pee disk (claim) and 1 small pee disk (fortify token).

**🏠 Home Turf** — Your home. One per player. Cannot be captured. Passing the adjacent sidewalk triggers a full resupply — but you must stop there and forfeit your remaining movement. Each home turf has exactly two adjacent territory spaces: your home neighbourhood.

**Paths** — Shortcut routes between two sidewalk spaces. When you pass the path entry sidewalk, you instantly move to the path exit sidewalk and continue moving for your remaining steps. Works like snakes and ladders.

**🐕 Dog Park** — Where alliances form. Passing the adjacent sidewalk gives you 1 Bond token. If another player's bond marker is here, passing triggers a compulsory join (see Alliances). You can stop here to initiate an alliance, which ends your movement.

**💧 Water Sources (Water Parks)** — Passing the adjacent sidewalk lets you optionally drink. Costs 1 Drive (Scrapper: free). Tops up water to your archetype max. Movement continues after drinking.

**🎲 Chance Spots / Events** — Not yet implemented.

## Your Dog

### The Dog Bowl

Your bowl is your personal dashboard:

- **Water pegs around the rim** — your bladder. Remove when taking pee-based actions. Refill at home or water sources.
- **Modifier tokens in the centre** — swagger (bones), drive (sticks), grit, and bond (hearts).

Pee disks live in the shared supply, not your bowl.

### The Four Modifiers

**Swagger** 💪 — Confidence. Spent to Claim, re-claim after winning challenges, and break alliances.

**Drive** ⚡ — Energy. Spent to Challenge, cross roads mid-block, drink water, and take shortcuts.

**Grit** 🦴 — Resolve. Spent to Fortify and re-claim. Accumulates when you lose a challenge.

**Bond** 🤝 — Friendship. Spent to initiate alliances at dog parks.

### Modifier Token Maxes

| Archetype | Swagger | Drive | Grit | Bond |
|-----------|---------|-------|------|------|
| Bruiser   | 3       | 2     | 2    | 1    |
| Scrapper  | 2       | 3     | 1    | 2    |
| Diplomat  | 2       | 1     | 2    | 3    |
| Yapper    | 1       | 2     | 3    | 2    |

Home resupply refills modifiers up to your archetype max. Board pickups (dog park bond, etc.) can push you above your home max — the max only applies at home resupply.

### The Four Archetypes

All archetypes roll **2d6** for movement. Every archetype can do every action.

## Economy — No Free Lunch

No basic income. Everything comes from the board.

**Home Turf** — Full resupply. Water + all modifiers to your archetype max. Costs you your remaining movement.

**Territory Holdings** — +1 Swagger per 3 connected territories at the start of your turn.

**Dog Park** — 1 Bond token when passing the adjacent sidewalk.

**Water Sources** — Top up water to your archetype max. Costs 1 Drive (Scrapper: free).

**Conflict** — Grit accumulates: lose a challenge (+1 Grit).

**Chance Spots** — Not yet implemented.

---

## Actions

After moving, take **one action** from your stopping position on the sidewalk. Actions target adjacent special spaces. You must at least move each turn — there is no pass.

### Claim
Spend **2 water + 1 Swagger**. Place a large pee disk on an **empty** adjacent territory.

### Challenge
Spend **2 water + 1 Drive**. Place a large pee disk on an **occupied** adjacent territory. Triggers a challenge roll (see Challenges).

### Fortify
Spend **1 water + 1 Grit**. Place a small pee disk on **your** adjacent territory. Max 1 per territory. Adds +1 to your defence roll.

### Ally (Initiate)
Spend **1 water + 1 Bond**. Place a small pee disk on an adjacent **dog park**. Sets the trap — any player who passes must join. This ends your movement for the turn.

### Break Alliance
Spend **1 water + 1 Swagger**. Destroy the entire bond stack at an adjacent dog park where you have a marker. All protections end.

---

## Alliances and the Dog Park

Dog parks are where friendships form. Once a bond marker is placed at a dog park, it becomes a social trap.

### Forming an Alliance

1. A player **initiates** by spending 1 water + 1 Bond from the adjacent sidewalk (stopping here ends movement).
2. Any player who **passes the adjacent sidewalk** of an active dog park **must join** — dogs can't resist. Cost: 1 water. Movement continues after joining.
3. Alliances can include 2, 3, or 4 players.

### What Bonding Does

**Immediately when you join an alliance:**
- Any claims you hold on territories adjacent to any existing bonded player's home turf are **cleared** — returned to empty.
- Any claims existing bonded players hold adjacent to **your** home turf are **cleared** — returned to empty.
- This is the price of friendship. You don't get to keep your foot on an ally's lawn.

**For the duration of the alliance:**
- No bonded player can challenge another bonded player's claims in either player's **home neighbourhood**.
- Non-bonded players can still claim and challenge those territories freely.

### Your Home Neighbourhood

The two territory spaces immediately adjacent to your Home Turf are your home neighbourhood. These are what the alliance protects — and what gets cleared when you bond.

### Breaking an Alliance

Any bonded player can spend 1 water + 1 Swagger from a sidewalk adjacent to the dog park. All bond markers returned to supply. All protections end immediately.

## Challenges

### The Roll
Both roll 1d6. **Attacker must roll higher to win.** Ties trigger a re-roll (except Cluster Rule).

### Defender Bonuses
- **Fortify token:** +1 to defender's roll (max 1 token per territory).
- **Cluster Rule:** Defender holds 3+ connected territories including this one → ties go to defender instead of re-rolling.
- **Alliance protection:** Territory is in a bonded ally's home neighbourhood → challenge is **illegal**.
- **Home Turf:** Cannot be challenged.

### Attacker Penalties
None.

### If You Win
Defender's large pee disk and fortify token returned to supply. Your challenge disk stays on the territory.

Spend **1 Swagger OR 1 Grit** to convert it into your claim. If you have neither, the disk is returned and the territory sits empty.

**Full conquest costs:** 2 water + 1 Drive + 1 Swagger or Grit.

### If You Lose
Your disk returned to supply. Defender keeps everything. You gain **+1 Grit**.

## Movement

All players roll **2d6**. Choose direction. You can backtrack. 

You always walk on **sidewalk spaces only**. Special spaces are never stepped on — they are interacted with from the adjacent sidewalk.

### Road Crossings
- **At intersections:** Free.
- **Mid-block:** 1 Drive token. Movement continues after crossing.

### Passing by (movement continues)
- **Water Source:** Optional drink — spend 1 Drive (Scrapper: free), top up water to max, keep moving.
- **Dog Park with active bond marker:** Compulsory join — spend 1 water, keep moving.
- **Dog Park without bond marker:** Receive 1 Bond token, keep moving.
- **Path entry:** cost 1 drive.  Instantly teleport to path exit sidewalk, continue moving for remaining steps.

### Stopping (forfeit remaining movement)
- **Home Turf adjacent sidewalk:** Full resupply.
- **Dog Park adjacent sidewalk:** Initiate alliance (your action for this turn).

---

## Water and Bladder

Every pee-based action costs water. When empty, you can't act.

**Home Turf** — Top up to archetype max. Free. Costs remaining movement.

**Water Sources** — Top up to archetype max. Costs 1 Drive (Scrapper: free). Movement continues.

For now, all water refills top up to your archetype max. The Water Chance deck is not yet implemented.

---

## Playing a Turn

1. **Territory Income** — Collect Swagger (+1 per 3 connected territories you own).
2. **Roll and Move** — Roll 2d6. Move along sidewalks. Spend Drive for mid-block crossings. Trigger pass-by effects as you go.
3. **Action Phase** — From your stopping position, take one action targeting an adjacent space: Claim, Challenge, Fortify, Ally (initiate), or Break Alliance.
4. **Home Resupply** — If you stopped at your home turf's adjacent sidewalk, refill water + modifiers to max.

**Turn order:** Random starting player. Go counterclockwise based on home turf positions. Fixed for the whole game.

*Swagger, Grit, Bond, and Drive are inspired by real chemicals in dog urine: testosterone, cortisol, oxytocin, and dopamine. When your dog marks a fire hydrant, it really is establishing its uri-nation.*
