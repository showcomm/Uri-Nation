## Goal

You are a dog. You live with your owner. You go on walks. On those walks, you pee on things to claim them as yours.

Your goal is to control the neighbourhood. You win by either:

1. **Territorial Dominance** — Hold 10 marked territories outside your Home Turf at the end of any turn.
2. **Last Dog Standing** — Be the only player who still holds territory outside their own backyard.
3. **Time's Up** — After 30 turns, the player with the most territory wins. Ties broken by most Fortify tokens, then highest Swagger.

---

## Setting Up

1. Place the board. Each player picks a breed card and takes their matching dog figurine, dog bowl, and player colour.
2. Fill your bowl rim with water pegs up to your archetype's max (Bruiser: 6, Scrapper: 3, Diplomat: 4, Yapper: 4).
3. Fill your bowl centre with modifier tokens up to your archetype's max (see your breed card).
4. Place the pee disks in a shared supply in the middle of the table. Pee disks are never stored in your bowl.
5. Place your dog figurine on your Home Turf space. You start on the sidewalk your home is on.
6. Place one large pee disk on your Home Turf and one on any adjacent empty territory. These are your starting claims (no cost).
7. Shuffle the three decks (Water Chance, Chance, Events) and place them face-down near the board.
8. Player with the least territory goes first (at start: roll off).

## The Board

The board is a neighbourhood street with **two sidewalks separated by a road**.

### Sidewalks

Two parallel walking paths, one on each side of the road. You walk along a sidewalk and interact with territory spaces, bond spaces, and other features that branch off it.

### The Road

The road is a **barrier**. You cannot walk along it. You can cross it:

- **Free at intersections.** Your owner naturally crosses at corners. No cost.
- **Mid-block crossing costs 1 Drive token.** You're dragging your owner across traffic. This can happen partway through your roll — walk some spaces, pay Drive, cross, keep walking on the other side.

### Side Streets

Branch off perpendicular from the sidewalks. Entering costs **1 Drive token per space** (same as shortcuts). May lead to cul-de-sacs with clustered territories.

### Space Types

**Territory spaces** — Yards, trees, poles, fences, driveways. These branch off the sidewalks. You claim them with large pee disks. Each can hold 1 large pee disk and up to 3 small pee disks (fortify tokens).

**Bond spaces** — Fire hydrants, bus stops, lamp posts. Fixed locations on the sidewalks with radiating lines showing their area of influence. You don't claim these — you place alliance markers on them.

**🏠 Home Turf** — Your home. One per player, each on a specific side of the road. Passing through triggers a full resupply (water + modifiers). +3 to your roll if someone challenges your Home Turf. Worth 0 VP.

**💧 Water Sources** — 4–5 scattered on both sides. Puddles, garden taps, neighbour's bowls. Drinking costs 1 Drive (Scrapper: free) and you draw a Water Chance card.

**🎲 Chance Spots** — 4–6 locations. Garbage bins, café scraps, interesting smells. Pass through to draw a Chance card. Your main source of Drive tokens during play.

**🐕 Dog Park** — 1 location. The only reliable source of Bond tokens on the board. Pass through to receive 1 Bond.

**📰 Events** — 1 location. Draw an Events card when passing through.

## Your Dog

### The Dog Bowl

Your bowl is your personal dashboard. It holds your spendable resources:

- **Water pegs around the rim** — your bladder. Remove pegs when you take actions that place pee disks on the board. Refill at home or water sources.
- **Modifier tokens in the centre** — swagger (bones), drive (sticks), grit, and bond (hearts).

Pee disks live in the shared supply, not in your bowl. When you take an action, you spend water pegs and modifier tokens from your bowl, and place a pee disk from the supply onto the board.

### The Four Modifiers

**Swagger** 💪 (bone-shaped) — Confidence. Spent to Claim territory, re-claim after winning challenges, and break alliances.

**Drive** ⚡ (stick-shaped) — Energy and aggression. Spent to Challenge opponents, cross the road, take shortcuts, and drink water.

**Grit** 🦴 — Defensive resolve. Spent to Fortify your territory and re-claim after winning challenges. Accumulates from conflict — penalty if you hold too many (see Challenges).

**Bond** 🤝 (heart-shaped) — Social connection. Spent to initiate alliances at bond spaces.

### Modifier Token Maxes

Each archetype has a maximum for each modifier. Home refills you **up to your max** — you can't hoard by looping home repeatedly. Board pickups (chance cards, dog park, territory bonuses) CAN push you above your home max.

| Archetype | Swagger | Drive | Grit | Bond |
|-----------|---------|-------|------|------|
| Bruiser   | 3       | 2     | 2    | 1    |
| Scrapper  | 2       | 3     | 1    | 2    |
| Diplomat  | 2       | 1     | 2    | 3    |
| Yapper    | 1       | 2     | 3    | 2    |

### The Four Archetypes

All archetypes roll **2d6** for movement. Every archetype can do every action. The difference is your modifier max, your water capacity, and one cost discount.

---

**The Bruiser** 🐕‍🦺
*Big. Confident. Marks like it owns the place.*

- Bowl: 6 water pegs.
- Modifier Max: Swagger 3, Drive 2, Grit 2, Bond 1.
- **Discount: Claims cost no Swagger** (just 2 water for the large pee disk).
- Identity: Dominates its sidewalk. Claims constantly and cheaply. Low Drive and Bond mean it stays on its side and fights alone. A steamroller on rails.

---

**The Scrapper** 🐕
*Small. Fast. Everywhere at once.*

- Bowl: 3 water pegs.
- Modifier Max: Swagger 2, Drive 3, Grit 1, Bond 2.
- **Discount: Drinking costs no Drive.**
- Identity: Crosses the road freely, hits every chance spot. Tiny bladder but free drinking keeps it going. Can't stockpile fortifications (1 Grit max from home). Fast but fragile.

---

**The Diplomat** 🦮
*Medium. Friendly. Everyone's best friend.*

- Bowl: 4 water pegs.
- Modifier Max: Swagger 2, Drive 1, Grit 2, Bond 3.
- **Discount: Ally initiation costs no Bond** (just 1 water for the small pee disk). Alliances must be joined for at least 1 turn by passing players (forced ceasefire).
- **Constraint: Challenges at −1 to attack roll.**
- Identity: Stuck on its side of the road (1 Drive). Plants bond traps everywhere. Weak alone but indispensable as an ally. Needs the dog park badly.

---

**The Yapper** 🐩
*Small to medium. Loud. Annoying to mess with.*

- Bowl: 4 water pegs.
- Modifier Max: Swagger 1, Drive 2, Grit 3, Bond 2.
- **Discount: Fortify costs no Grit** (just 1 water for the small pee disk). Any Challenge against a Yapper's territory gives the attacker +1 Grit (win or lose).
- Identity: Barely any claims from home (1 Swagger), but can challenge with Drive and re-claim with Grit. The turtle that bites — takes territory through fights, then digs in.

---

## Economy — No Free Lunch

There is **no basic income.** You don't get free tokens each turn. Everything comes from the board.

**Home Turf** — Full resupply. Water refilled to max. All modifiers refilled to your archetype max. But going home takes you away from the action.

**Territory Holdings** — +1 Swagger per 2–3 connected territories you hold, collected at the start of your turn. Own more, feel more confident.

**Chance Spots** — Draw a Chance card when passing through. Mostly Drive tokens (food finds), occasionally Swagger, Grit, or rare Bond. Some mixed results.

**Dog Park** — 1 Bond token when passing through. The only reliable bond source outside home.

**Water Sources** — Draw a Water Chance card. Risky refills.

**Conflict** — Grit accumulates involuntarily: lose a challenge (+1 Grit), challenge a Yapper (+1 Grit), bad water draws, desperation bonus (+2 Grit if you hold fewer than 3 territories).

---

## Actions

On your turn, after moving, you take **one action** at your stopping position. You spend water pegs and modifier tokens from your bowl. If the action places a pee disk, it comes from the shared supply and goes straight onto the board.

### Claim

Spend 2 water pegs + 1 Swagger. Place a large pee disk from supply on an **empty** territory adjacent to your position.

*Bruiser discount: no Swagger needed.*

### Challenge

Spend 2 water pegs + 1 Drive. Place a large pee disk from supply on an **occupied** territory adjacent to your position. This triggers a challenge roll (see Challenges below).

### Fortify

Spend 1 water peg + 1 Grit. Place a small pee disk from supply on one of **your** claimed territories adjacent to your position. Max 3 fortify tokens per territory. Each adds +1 to your defense roll.

*Yapper discount: no Grit needed.*

### Ally (Initiate)

Spend 1 water peg + 1 Bond. Place a small pee disk from supply on a **bond space** adjacent to your position. This sets a trap — any player who passes this bond space must join the alliance.

*Diplomat discount: no Bond needed.*

### Break Alliance

Spend 1 water peg + 1 Swagger. Place a small pee disk from supply to destroy the **entire bond stack** at a bond space where you have a marker. All markers returned to supply. The alliance is dissolved.

### Pass

Do nothing.

---

## Challenges

When you Challenge, you're over-peeing someone else's territory. Both players roll dice to resolve it.

### The Roll

Both roll 1d6. **Attacker must roll higher to win.** Ties re-roll (with one exception — see Cluster Rule).

### Defender Bonuses

- **Fortify tokens:** +1 per small pee disk on the territory (max +3).
- **Cluster Rule:** If the defender holds **3 or more connected territories** (including the one being challenged), **ties go to the defender.** Build clusters, not scattered outposts.
- **Home Turf:** +3 to defender's roll. Home is nearly unassailable.
- **Alliance protection:** If both players are bonded at an adjacent bond space, the challenge is **illegal.**

### Attacker Penalties

- **Grit penalty:** If holding more than 5 Grit tokens, subtract the excess from your roll.
- **Diplomat penalty:** −1 to attack roll (Diplomats are lovers, not fighters).
- **Yapper penalty:** Challenging a Yapper's territory gives you +1 Grit, win or lose.

### If You Win

The defender's large pee disk and all fortify tokens are returned to the shared supply. Your challenge disk stays on the territory.

You may immediately **re-claim** by spending **1 Swagger OR 1 Grit**. Your disk is already there — the modifier converts it into your claim. Swagger = confident claim. Grit = dig in defensively. If you have neither, your disk is returned to supply and the territory stays empty for anyone to grab.

**Full conquest costs:** 2 water + 1 Drive + 1 Swagger or Grit.

### If You Lose

Your large pee disk is returned to supply. Defender keeps everything. You gain +1 Grit (humiliation).

### Challenging a Bond

Same roll, but targeting a bond space. Defender rolls d6 + 1 per small pee disk on the bond. Win destroys the entire alliance. Lose costs you the disk + 1 Grit.

---

## Alliances and Bond Spaces

Bond spaces (fire hydrants, bus stops, lamp posts) have **areas of influence** — radiating lines showing which territories they protect.

### How Alliances Form

1. A player **initiates** by spending 1 water + 1 Bond and placing a small pee disk from supply on a bond space.
2. Any player who **passes through** an active bond space **must join.** This is involuntary — dogs can't resist marking a hydrant another dog has marked. Cost: 1 water peg. The bank provides a small pee disk in your colour from supply.
3. Alliances can include 2, 3, or 4 players.

### What Alliances Do

All bonded players at a space **cannot challenge each other's territories** connected to that bond space. The bond creates a demilitarized zone.

### Breaking an Alliance

Any bonded player can spend 1 water + 1 Swagger (placing a small pee disk from supply) to destroy the **entire bond stack.** All markers returned to supply. All territories in the zone are now open for challenges. Game of chicken — everyone benefits, but someone has to pay to end it.

---

## Movement

### Rolling

All players roll **2d6**. Choose which direction to walk along your sidewalk. You can backtrack. You can stop early.

### Road Crossings

- **At intersections:** Free.
- **Mid-block:** 1 Drive token. Can happen partway through your roll.

### Side Streets and Shortcuts

1 Drive per space off the main sidewalk.

### Passing Through

As you move, spaces you pass through can trigger effects:

- **Water Sources:** Optional drink (1 Drive, Scrapper free). Draw Water Chance card.
- **Chance Spots:** Draw a Chance card.
- **Dog Park:** Receive 1 Bond token.
- **Active Bond Spaces:** Compulsory join (1 water).
- **Events:** Draw an Events card.

**Actions** (Claim, Challenge, Fortify, Ally) can only be taken at your **stopping position.**

---

## Water and Bladder

Your water pegs are your ammunition. Every action that places a pee disk costs water. When you're empty, you can't take any pee-based action.

### Refilling

**Home Turf** — Refill to full. Free. No Drive cost.

**Water Sources** — Cost 1 Drive (Scrapper: free). Draw a Water Chance card:

| Grade | Roughly | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 💎 Clean | 5 cards | Full refill. Possible +1 Bond bonus. |
| 👍 Decent | 8 cards | Half refill (rounded up). |
| 😬 Questionable | 7 cards | Half refill + penalty (+1 Grit, −1 Drive, or −1 Swagger). |
| ☠️ Terrible | 4 cards | No refill + penalty (+2 Grit, lose 1 water, or skip next action). |

Drinking is always optional.

### Water Math

- Bruiser (6 water): 3 large pee actions or 6 small pee actions per fill.
- Scrapper (3 water): 1 large + 1 small, or 3 small. Constantly hunting water, but drinks free.
- Diplomat/Yapper (4 water): 2 large or 4 small actions.

---

## Playing a Turn

### 1. Territory Income

Collect Swagger from territory holdings (+1 per 2–3 connected territories). If you hold fewer than 3 territories, collect desperation bonus (+2 Grit).

### 2. Roll and Move

Roll 2d6. Choose direction. Move along your sidewalk. Spend Drive for road crossings, side streets, shortcuts. Trigger pass-through effects (Water Sources, Chance Spots, Dog Park, active Bond Spaces, Events).

### 3. Action Phase

At your stopping position: Claim, Challenge, Fortify, Ally, Break Alliance, or Pass. Spend water + modifiers from your bowl. Pee disk placed from shared supply to board.

### 4. Home Resupply

If you passed or landed on your Home Turf this turn: refill water to full, refill all modifiers to your archetype max.

### 5. Maintenance

Housebound check: 0 non-home territories for 2 consecutive turns = Housebound (walk halved, no territory bonuses). Recover by claiming any territory.

**Turn order:** Player with the least territory goes first each round. Ties: roll off.

*Swagger, Grit, Bond, and Drive are inspired by real chemicals in dog urine: testosterone, cortisol, oxytocin, and dopamine. When your dog marks a fire hydrant, it really is establishing its uri-nation.*
