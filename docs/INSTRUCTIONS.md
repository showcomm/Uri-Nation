## Goal

You are a dog. You live with your owner. You go on walks. On those walks, you pee on things to claim them as yours.

Your goal is to control the neighbourhood. You win by either:

1. **Territorial Dominance** — Be the first player to hold 10 marked spaces outside your Home Turf, OR
2. **Last Dog Standing** — Be the only player who still holds territory outside their own backyard.

---

## Setting Up

1. Place the board. Each player picks a breed card and takes their matching pawn and colour pieces.
2. Place your pawn on your Home Turf corner.
3. Place one Small mark on your Home Turf and one on any adjacent space. These are your starting claims.
4. Set your chemical tracks to the starting values on your breed card. Set bladder to full.
5. Shuffle the Neighbourhood News deck and place it face-down on the News square.
6. Shuffle the Water Quality deck and place it face-down beside the board.
7. Player with the least territory goes first (at start: roll off).

---

## The Board

The board is a neighbourhood. It has three elements:

### The Main Loop

A path of roughly 30–40 spaces forming a circuit through the neighbourhood. This is the route your owner walks every day. Your pawn moves along this loop by default.

Four **🏠 Home Turfs** are spaced around the loop, one per player. One **📰 Neighbourhood News** square sits on the loop.

### Side Streets

Branches off the main loop leading to cul-de-sacs, small clusters, or dead ends. These spaces are reachable but require you to leave the main loop (see Movement).

### Shortcuts

Paths connecting non-adjacent parts of the board — unfenced backyards, walking trails between streets, gaps in hedges, open fields. These let you skip sections of the main loop or jump between side streets. Using them requires spending Drive (see Movement).

### Water Sources

Scattered around the board are **💧 Water Sources** — puddles, ditches, a kind neighbour's water bowl, a leaky garden tap. There are 4–5 of these, some on the main loop and some on side streets.

When you land on or pass through a Water Source, you may choose to drink (see Water and Bladder).

---

## The Board Spaces

Every markable space on the board is the same. There are no categories or types. What makes a space valuable is **what is next to it**.

### Territory Clusters and the Adjacency Bonus

Marks are placed face-up. Everyone can see who owns what. Marks stay permanently until overmarked. There is no decay.

**A mark gets +1 defense for each adjacent space you also own, up to +3.**

Adjacent means directly connected by a path on the board.

- A lone mark has no bonus. Exposed.
- A mark with one friendly neighbour gets +1.
- A mark inside a cluster gets +2 or +3. Hard to crack.

Build connected territory, not scattered outposts. Attack clusters from the edges where the bonus is weakest.

### Special Spaces

**🏠 Home Turf** — Defender gets +3 on Challenge rolls. Marks here revert to the owner after 1 turn if taken. Worth no victory points. Passing through your own Home Turf triggers a safe water refill (see Water and Bladder).

**📰 Neighbourhood News** — Draw a card when you land on or pass through.

**💧 Water Source** — Choose to drink when you land on or pass through. Draw from the Water Quality deck.

---

## Water and Bladder

Your bladder is your ammunition. Every mark costs bladder. When it's empty, you can't mark anything. Managing your water supply is as important as managing your chemicals.

### Refilling at Home

When your pawn lands on or passes through your own **🏠 Home Turf**, you may refill your bladder by **half its maximum** (rounded up). This is safe — no risk, no surprises. You had a drink from your bowl in the kitchen.

You can only refill at home **once per turn**, even if you pass through it multiple times.

### Drinking from Water Sources

When your pawn lands on or passes through a **💧 Water Source**, you may choose to stop and drink. Draw a card from the **Water Quality deck**.

Water Quality cards come in four grades:

**💎 Clean Water**
*"Fresh puddle after the sprinkler" / "Kind neighbour's water bowl" / "Garden hose dripping"*
Full bladder refill to maximum. Sometimes a bonus: +1 Bond ("friendly neighbourhood vibes").

**👍 Decent Water**
*"Rainwater puddle" / "Slow drip from a garden tap"*
Refill half bladder (rounded up). No side effects.

**😬 Questionable Water**
*"Stagnant ditch" / "Old puddle by the road" / "Mysterious brown water"*
Refill half bladder BUT take a penalty: +1 Nerves (stomach unease), or -1 Drive next turn (sluggish), or -1 Swagger (feeling rough).

**☠️ Terrible Water**
*"That is definitely not water" / "Puddle next to the bins" / "Something died near this"*
No refill. Penalty: +2 Nerves, or lose 1 Bladder (vomit), or skip your action next turn (sick).

The deck should contain roughly: 20% Clean, 35% Decent, 30% Questionable, 15% Terrible.

**Drinking is always optional.** You may pass through a Water Source and choose not to drink. Sometimes the risk isn't worth it — especially if your Nerves are already high.

### The Water Decision

This creates a constant route-planning tension:

- Your Home Turf is safe water but might be out of your way.
- Water Sources are scattered conveniently near contested areas but carry risk.
- The Bruiser's big bladder (6) means fewer water stops needed.
- The Scrapper's tiny bladder (3) means constant water hunting — risky puddles become tempting.
- A player who controls the spaces around a Water Source doesn't own the water, but their opponents have to enter hostile territory to drink.

## Your Dog

### Archetypes and Breeds

Every dog belongs to one of four **archetypes**. The archetype determines your stats, your bladder size, your movement, and your cost discount. Every action in the game is available to every archetype — but each archetype gets **one thing cheaper**, making it naturally better at a particular style of play.

Your **breed** is flavour. It's the picture on your card, the funny bio, and maybe a minor once-per-game ability. A Rottweiler, a Great Dane, and a Newfoundland are all Bruisers. A Chihuahua and a Jack Russell are both Scrappers. A Pomeranian could be a Yapper. A Corgi could be anything. Pick the dog you love.

### The Four Chemicals

Every dog tracks the same four chemicals:

**Swagger** 💪 — Assertiveness. Spent to Claim and Challenge.

**Nerves** 😰 — Stress and defense. Spent to Fortify. Penalty if above 5 (excess subtracted from Challenge rolls).

**Bond** 🤝 — Social currency. Spent on alliances.

**Drive** ⚡ — Alertness and navigation. Spent to leave the main loop (1 per space off-route).

### The Four Archetypes

Every archetype can do everything. The discount just tilts your play style.

---

**The Bruiser** 🐕‍🦺
*Big. Confident. Marks like it owns the place.*

Bladder: 6. Walk: Roll 1 die.
Starting chemicals: Swagger 4, Nerves 1, Bond 1, Drive 2.
Chemical refill: Swagger +2, Nerves +0, Bond +1, Drive +1.

**Discount: Claims cost 1 less Swagger.** Small Claim = 1 Bladder + 1 Swagger. Large Claim = 2 Bladder + 3 Swagger. The Bruiser stamps its mark on everything it passes.

**Constraint: Detours cost 2 Drive per space** (instead of 1). Big dog, hard to steer. The owner is being walked.

**Constraint: Can only interact every other space.** The owner keeps the leash tight and short — your big body can't lunge at every post.

*Playstyle:* Dominate whatever's on the main loop. Huge bladder means fewer water stops. Powerful claims. But slow, predictable, and expensive to redirect. You are a steamroller on rails.

---

**The Scrapper** 🐕
*Small. Fast. Everywhere at once.*

Bladder: 3. Walk: Roll 2 dice.
Starting chemicals: Swagger 3, Nerves 1, Bond 1, Drive 3.
Chemical refill: Swagger +1, Nerves +1, Bond +1, Drive +2.

**Discount: Detours are free.** The Scrapper moves on and off the main loop, through shortcuts, down side streets — all without spending Drive. This dog drags its owner everywhere.

**Constraint: Small marks only.** The Scrapper can never place Large disks. Its marks have base defense 1. Easy to overmark.

*Playstyle:* Cover the entire board. Claim fast, claim wide. Your marks are thin but you can be anywhere. You outrun the Bruiser and outflank the Yapper. But you're always thirsty — that tiny bladder means constant water hunting.

---

**The Diplomat** 🦮
*Medium. Friendly. Everyone's best friend.*

Bladder: 4. Walk: Roll 1 die + 2.
Starting chemicals: Swagger 2, Nerves 1, Bond 3, Drive 2.
Chemical refill: Swagger +1, Nerves +0, Bond +2, Drive +1.

**Discount: Bond Signals cost 1 less Bond** (1 Bladder + 1 Bond). And when the Diplomat proposes an alliance, the other player **must accept for at least 1 turn** before they can break it. Not permanent — a forced ceasefire. One round of peace.

**Constraint: Challenges at -1.** The Diplomat subtracts 1 from all Challenge attack rolls. It genuinely cannot fight well.

*Playstyle:* Make alliances. Play kingmaker. Use your forced ceasefires to protect weak flanks and create buffer zones. You won't win fights, so don't start them. Win by making yourself too useful to attack.

---

**The Yapper** 🐩
*Small to medium. Loud. Annoying to mess with.*

Bladder: 4. Walk: Roll 1 die.
Starting chemicals: Swagger 1, Nerves 2, Bond 1, Drive 3.
Chemical refill: Swagger +1, Nerves +1, Bond +1, Drive +2.

**Discount: Fortify costs only Bladder** (1 Bladder, no Nerves required). The Yapper compulsively re-marks its territory. Fortifying is practically free.

**Bonus: Any Challenge against a Yapper's mark costs the attacker +1 extra Nerves**, win or lose. The barking alone is stressful. Attacking a Yapper's turf wears you down even if you succeed.

**Constraint: Small marks only**, like the Scrapper. And the **shortest walk roll** (1 die, no modifier). Doesn't go far.

*Playstyle:* Turtle. Claim a small tight cluster near home. Fortify everything cheaply. Make your territory so annoying to attack that opponents go fight each other instead. Win by being the last dog standing while the Bruiser and Scrapper exhaust themselves, or by slowly expanding your fortress outward.

---

## Movement

### Your Owner Walks the Loop

By default, your pawn moves along the **main loop** in one direction (your choice at game start — clockwise or anticlockwise, fixed for the whole game). Each turn you roll and advance that many spaces along the loop.

**Your pawn stays on the board between turns.** You are always somewhere in the neighbourhood. Next turn, you continue from where you stopped.

### Leaving the Main Loop

At any point during your movement, if your pawn reaches a junction where a **side street** or **shortcut** branches off the main loop, you may take it.

**Cost: 1 Drive per space off the main loop** (Bruiser: 2 Drive per space. Scrapper: free. Diplomat: 1 Drive per 2 spaces, rounded up).

This represents pulling your owner off their usual route. Your owner does not want to go down that alley. You are dragging them. It costs effort.

Once off the loop, you keep spending Drive per space to continue. You can stop at any point if you run out of Drive or choose to conserve it.

### Getting Back

Returning to the main loop from a side street costs nothing extra — you just move toward the loop as part of your normal roll on a subsequent turn. The cost was getting off; getting back is free.

**Shortcuts** connect distant parts of the board. Entering a shortcut costs Drive like any off-loop movement, but shortcuts are typically short (1–3 spaces), so they are efficient ways to reposition.

### Stopping Early

You never have to use your full roll. You may stop at any point. This is often smart — you spot a space you want to mark, or a water source you want to drink from, or a contested border you want to Fortify.

### Passing Through

As you move, you pass through spaces. You may trigger Water Source or News square effects when passing through, even if you don't stop there. But you can only take a **marking action** (Claim, Challenge, Fortify, Bond Signal) at the space where you stop.

---

## Playing a Turn

### Step 1: Roll and Move

Roll your walk dice. Move your pawn up to that many spaces. Spend Drive if leaving the main loop. Stop when you choose.

Trigger any Water Sources or News squares you pass through along the way.

### Step 2: Take One Action

At your stopping point, choose one action on that space or an adjacent space:

**Claim** — Mark an empty space.
- Small: 1 Bladder + 2 Swagger (Bruiser: 1 Swagger). Defense 1.
- Large: 2 Bladder + 4 Swagger (Bruiser: 3 Swagger). Defense 2.
- *Scrapper and Yapper: Small only.*

**Challenge** — Overmark an opponent's space. Cost: 2 Bladder + 3 Swagger + 1 Nerves.
- Attacker: d6 + your disk size − Nerves penalty (if Nerves > 5, subtract excess). Diplomat: additional -1.
- Defender: d6 + disk size + Fortify + adjacency bonus (max +3) + Home Turf (+3) + Alliance (+1)
- Must beat defender. Ties to defender.
- Win: replace their mark with yours.
- Lose: resources wasted, gain +1 Nerves.
- *Attacking a Yapper's mark: attacker gains +1 Nerves win or lose (on top of normal costs).*

**Fortify** — Reinforce your own mark. Cost: 1 Bladder + 2 Nerves (Yapper: 1 Bladder only). Add +1 defense token (max 3 per space).

**Bond Signal** — Propose alliance. Cost: 1 Bladder + 2 Bond (Diplomat: 1 Bond). Place white token adjacent to another player's mark. They accept on their turn. Diplomat's proposals must be accepted for at least 1 turn.
- Alliance rules: Can't attack each other's adjacent marks. +1 defense vs others. Costs 1 Bond per turn. Max 2 alliances. Breaks if either attacks the other.

**Pass** — Do nothing. Walk away.

### Step 3: Refill (after all players have walked)

**Bladder** does NOT automatically refill each turn. You refill by passing through Home or drinking from Water Sources during your walk. This is the only way to get bladder back.

**Chemicals** refill by your breed's base rate. Then: for every 3 connected spaces you hold (not counting Home Turf), gain +1 to any chemical of your choice. No chemical exceeds 10.

**Desperation bonus:** Fewer than 3 non-home spaces? Gain +2 Nerves.

### Step 4: Maintenance

Pay 1 Bond per alliance. Can't pay = alliance breaks.

Housebound check: 0 non-home spaces for 2 consecutive turns = Housebound (walk rolls halved, no territory bonuses, recover by claiming any space).

*Swagger, Nerves, Bond, and Drive are renamed from real hormones in dog urine: testosterone, cortisol, oxytocin, and dopamine. When your dog marks a fire hydrant, it really is establishing its uri-nation.*
