## Goal

You are a dog. You live with your owner. You go on walks. On those walks, you pee on things to claim them as yours.

Your goal is to control the neighbourhood. You win by either:

1. **Territorial Dominance** — Hold 10 marked territories outside your Home Turf at the end of any turn.
2. **Last Dog Standing** — Be the only player who still holds territory outside their own backyard.
3. **Time's Up** — After 30 turns, the player with the most territory wins. Ties broken by most Fortify tokens, then highest Swagger.

---

## Setting Up

1. Place the board. Each player picks a breed card and takes their matching dog figurine, dog bowl, and player colour.
2. Fill your bowl rim with water pegs up to your archetype's max (Bruiser: 6, Scrapper: 3, Diplomat: 4, Yapper: 4).
3. Fill your bowl centre with modifier tokens up to your archetype's max (see your breed card).
4. Place the pee disks in a shared supply in the middle of the table. Pee disks are never stored in your bowl.
5. Place your dog figurine on your Home Turf space.
6. Place one large pee disk on any empty territory adjacent to your Home Turf. This is your starting claim (no cost).
7. Shuffle the three decks (Water Chance, Chance, Events) and place them face-down near the board.
8. Player with the least territory goes first (at start: roll off).

## The Board

The board is a neighbourhood of city blocks arranged in a grid. Roads run between the blocks. Sidewalks run along each block face. You walk along the sidewalks.

### Roads and Crossing

Roads are barriers. You cannot walk along them. You can cross them:

- **Free at intersections.** Your owner naturally crosses at corners. No cost.
- **Mid-block crossing costs 1 Drive token.** You're dragging your owner across traffic. This can happen partway through your roll.

### Space Types

**Territory spaces** — Residential properties along the sidewalks. Yard, driveway, house. You claim the driveway by placing a large pee disk there. Each territory holds 1 large pee disk and up to 3 small pee disks (fortify tokens).

**🏠 Home Turf** — Your home. One per player. **Cannot be captured.** Passing through triggers a full resupply (water + modifiers). Worth 0 VP. Placed at a non-corner position so it has exactly two neighbouring territories — your home neighbourhood.

**🐕 Dog Park** — Where alliances form. Pass through to receive 1 Bond token. If another player's bond marker is already here, you must join their alliance (see Alliances).

**💧 Water Sources** — Puddles, garden taps. Drinking costs 1 Drive (Scrapper: free) and you draw a Water Chance card.

**🎲 Chance Spots** — Garbage bins, café scraps. Pass through to draw a Chance card. Your main source of Drive tokens.

**📰 Events** — Draw an Events card when passing through.

## Your Dog

### The Dog Bowl

Your bowl is your personal dashboard:

- **Water pegs around the rim** — your bladder. Remove when taking pee-based actions. Refill at home or water sources.
- **Modifier tokens in the centre** — swagger (bones), drive (sticks), grit, and bond (hearts).

Pee disks live in the shared supply, not your bowl.

### The Four Modifiers

**Swagger** 💪 — Confidence. Spent to Claim, re-claim after winning challenges, and break alliances.

**Drive** ⚡ — Energy. Spent to Challenge, cross roads mid-block, and drink water.

**Grit** 🦴 — Resolve. Spent to Fortify and re-claim. Accumulates from conflict — penalty if you hold too many.

**Bond** 🤝 — Friendship. Spent to initiate alliances at dog parks.

### Modifier Token Maxes

| Archetype | Swagger | Drive | Grit | Bond |
|-----------|---------|-------|------|------|
| Bruiser   | 3       | 2     | 2    | 1    |
| Scrapper  | 2       | 3     | 1    | 2    |
| Diplomat  | 2       | 1     | 2    | 3    |
| Yapper    | 1       | 2     | 3    | 2    |

### The Four Archetypes

All archetypes roll **2d6** for movement. Every archetype can do every action.

- Bowl: 6 water pegs. Modifier Max: Swagger 3, Drive 2, Grit 2, Bond 1.

**The Scrapper** 🐕 — *Small. Fast. Everywhere at once.*

## Economy — No Free Lunch

No basic income. Everything comes from the board.

**Home Turf** — Full resupply. Water + all modifiers to your max. Takes you off the board.

**Territory Holdings** — +1 Swagger per 2–3 connected territories at the start of your turn.

**Chance Spots** — Mostly Drive, occasionally Swagger or Grit, rarely Bond.

**Dog Park** — 1 Bond token when passing through.

**Water Sources** — Risky refills via Water Chance card.

**Conflict** — Grit accumulates: lose a challenge (+1), challenge a Yapper (+1), bad water, desperation (fewer than 3 territories: +2).

---

## Actions

After moving, take **one action** at your stopping position.

### Claim
Spend 2 water + 1 Swagger. Place a large pee disk on an **empty** adjacent territory.
*Bruiser: no Swagger needed.*

### Challenge
Spend 2 water + 1 Drive. Place a large pee disk on an **occupied** adjacent territory. Triggers a challenge roll (see Challenges).

### Fortify
Spend 1 water + 1 Grit. Place a small pee disk on **your** adjacent territory. Max 3. Each adds +1 to your defence roll.
*Yapper: no Grit needed.*

### Ally (Initiate)
Spend 1 water + 1 Bond. Place a small pee disk on an adjacent **dog park**. Sets the trap — any player who passes must join.
*Diplomat: no Bond needed.*

### Break Alliance
Spend 1 water + 1 Swagger. Destroy the entire bond stack at a dog park where you have a marker. All protections end.

### Pass
Do nothing.

## Alliances and the Dog Park

Dog parks are where friendships form. Once a bond marker is placed at a dog park, it becomes a social trap.

### Forming an Alliance

1. A player **initiates** by spending 1 water + 1 Bond at a dog park (Diplomat: no Bond needed).
2. Any player who **passes through** an active dog park **must join** — dogs can't resist. Cost: 1 water. A small pee disk in your colour is placed from the bank.
3. Alliances can include 2, 3, or 4 players.

### What Bonding Does

**Immediately when you join an alliance:**
- Any claims you hold on territories adjacent to any existing bonded player's home turf are **cleared** — returned to empty.
- Any claims existing bonded players hold adjacent to **your** home turf are **cleared** — returned to empty.
- This is the price of friendship. You don't get to keep your foot on an ally's lawn.

**For the duration of the alliance:**
- No bonded player can challenge another bonded player's claims in either player's **home neighbourhood** (the two territories adjacent to their home turf).
- Non-bonded players can still claim and challenge those territories freely — the protection is only between allies.

### Your Home Neighbourhood

The two territory spaces immediately adjacent to your Home Turf are your home neighbourhood. These are what the alliance protects — and what gets cleared when you bond.

### Breaking an Alliance

Any bonded player can spend 1 water + 1 Swagger to destroy the entire bond stack. All markers returned. All protections end. It's a declaration of war — you're coming for their neighbourhood.

## Challenges

### The Roll
Both roll 1d6. **Attacker must roll higher to win.** Ties re-roll (except Cluster Rule).

### Defender Bonuses
- **Fortify tokens:** +1 per small pee disk (max +3).
- **Cluster Rule:** Defender holds 3+ connected territories including this one → ties go to defender.
- **Alliance protection:** Territory is in bonded ally's home neighbourhood → challenge is **illegal.**

### Attacker Penalties
- **Grit penalty:** More than 5 Grit tokens → subtract excess from roll.
- **Diplomat penalty:** −1 to attack roll.
- **Yapper penalty:** +1 Grit to attacker, win or lose.

### Home Turfs
Home turfs **cannot be captured.** Challenges against them are illegal.

### If You Win
Defender's large pee disk and all fortify tokens returned to supply. Your challenge disk **stays on the territory.**

Spend **1 Swagger OR 1 Grit** to convert it into your claim. If you have neither, the disk is returned and the territory sits empty.

**Full conquest costs:** 2 water + 1 Drive + 1 Swagger or Grit.

### If You Lose
Your disk returned to supply. Defender keeps everything. You gain +1 Grit.
